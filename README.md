# Herb Detection Machine Learning Model

Welcome to our Herb Detection Machine Learning Model, a sophisticated and highly accurate solution meticulously crafted using TensorFlow. This model is designed to identify Indian herbs and medicinal plants, leveraging a rich and diverse dataset sourced from Kaggle, featuring a remarkable 80 classes of Indian plants. Our goal is to contribute to the preservation and exploration of the vast botanical diversity found in the Indian subcontinent.

## Project Overview

Our Herb Detection Model represents a culmination of extensive research and development efforts. We are dedicated to enhancing our understanding of Indian herbs, their diverse varieties, and their vital role in traditional medicine and botanical research. With a sharp focus on accuracy and practical utility, our model has achieved an impressive performance level, making it an invaluable resource for botanists, researchers, and enthusiasts.

## Key Features

### 1. Dataset from Kaggle

- **Diversity and Authenticity:** We've harnessed a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle ([Indian Medicinal Leaves Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/indian-medicinal-leaves-dataset/data?select=Indian+Medicinal+Leaves+Image+Datasets)) that spans a wide array of Indian plants, featuring 80 meticulously documented and labeled classes.
- **Ground-Truth Labels:** Every data point in our dataset is accompanied by precise, expert-verified labels, ensuring the highest quality of training and evaluation.

### 2. Exceptional Accuracy

- **Cutting-Edge Performance:** Our machine learning model consistently achieves an accuracy rate of 97% after just 20 training epochs, a testament to our dedication to using state-of-the-art techniques and fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

### 3. Google Colab with Tesla T4 GPU

- **Powered by Google Colab:** To make robust training accessible to all, we harnessed the free GPU resources provided by Google Colab.
- **Tesla T4 GPU:** Our model training benefited from the performance and capabilities of the Tesla T4 GPU, enhancing the efficiency and speed of the training process.

### 4. TensorFlow Lite Integration

- **Mobile Accessibility:** To make this valuable resource more accessible, we've converted the model into a mobile-friendly TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) format, making it well-suited for deployment on mobile devices.
- **Flutter Integration:** Our ultimate goal is to integrate this TFLite model into a user-friendly and intuitive Flutter mobile application, allowing users to identify Indian herbs conveniently and accurately, right from their smartphones.

### 5. Model on GitHub

- **Access the TFLite Model:** You can find our TensorFlow Lite model file on our GitHub repository: [Herb Classifier TFLite](https://github.com/KaustubhVaidya404/herbclassifiertflitefile). Download it and integrate it into your own applications for herb detection.

## Use Cases

- **Botanical Exploration:** Researchers and botanists can expedite their work by using our model for rapid and accurate identification and cataloging of Indian herbs.
- **Educational Excellence:** Students and educators can explore and learn about the rich diversity of Indian plant species, enriching their understanding of traditional knowledge.
- **Herbal Enthusiasts:** Herb enthusiasts and nature lovers can harness the power of our model for plant identification and a deeper appreciation of the natural world.

## Conclusion

Our Herb Detection Machine Learning Model is more than just a technological achievement; it's a profound contribution to the preservation and exploration of India's natural wealth. With its exceptional accuracy, the use of Google Colab with a Tesla T4 GPU, and the exciting prospect of integration into a user-friendly Flutter mobile application, it promises to be an indispensable tool for anyone passionate about Indian herb identification, botanical research, and the rich heritage of traditional medicine.

Access the TFLite model from our GitHub repository, and stay tuned for the upcoming integration into the Flutter mobile app. Embark on an inspiring journey to discover and celebrate India's remarkable botanical diversity!
